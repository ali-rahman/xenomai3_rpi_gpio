SHORT:

     booting with a Device Tree
  
       The kernel no longer contains the description of the hardware, it is located in a separate binary: the device tree blob
  
       The bootloader loads two binaries: the kernel image and the DTB
           Kernel image remains uImage or zImage
           DTB located in arch/arm/boot/dts, one per board
  
       The bootloader passes the DTB address through r2.  (to the kernel)
       It(the bootloader) is supposed to adjust the DTB with 
          - memory information, 
          - kernel command line, 
          - and potentially other info.
          
         => I suspect the raspbian bootloader reads the kernel commandline from /boot/commandline.txt  
 
 
      DTB  u/zImage 
       /\
        `-- r2: pointer to DTB  given to kernel
    

     
      
so for new bootloaders 

    CONFIG_ATAGS=n  
    CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB=n
    
  => which is set as such by the raspbian default kernel configs

Extend bootloader kernel arguments
==================================


in my older builds I used: 

    https://www.blaess.fr/christophe/2016/05/22/xenomai-3-sur-raspberry-pi-2/

    A last modification is necessary; it is not specific to Xenomai. 
    This ensures that the kernel will have good arguments on its command line.

 Theory
 =======
 
 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24448680/what-are-atags-for-a-device-that-uses-linux-kernel 
     ATAGS are ARM tags. They are used to carry information such as memory size from boot code to kernel. 
 


 from device tree for dummies
 ----------------------------

 User perspective: before the Device Tree

   The kernel contains the entire description of the hardware.
  
   The bootloader loads a single binary, the kernel image, and executes it.
        uImage or zImage
       
   The bootloader prepares some additional information, called ATAGS, which address is passed to the kernel through register r2
        Contains information such as 
          - memory size and location, 
          - kernel command line, 
           etc.


   ATAGS  u/zImage 
    /\
     `-- r2: pointer to ATAGS  passed to the kernel


   => so CONFIG_ATAGS=y


 User perspective: booting with a Device Tree
  
   The kernel no longer contains the description of the hardware, it is located in a separate binary: the device tree blob
  
   The bootloader loads two binaries: the kernel image and the DTB
       Kernel image remains uImage or zImage
       DTB located in arch/arm/boot/dts, one per board
  
   The bootloader passes the DTB address through r2.  (to the kernel)
   It(the bootloader) is supposed to adjust the DTB with 
      - memory information, 
      - kernel command line, 
      - and potentially other info.
 
 
  DTB  u/zImage 
   /\
    `-- r2: pointer to DTB  given to kernel
 
 
     
   note: in the old situation the bootloader put this information  in a ATAGS memory block which address was
         passed to the kernel, and the kernel with support for ATAGS could read this information from the ATAGS
         memory block.
         In the new situation we have a device tree. The bootloader doesn't put this information in the obsolete ATAGS
         anymore, but in the device tree memory block. The kernel has support for the device tree and can then 
         read this information together with all other hardware information from the device tree memory block.

     

     => so in new situation CONFIG_ATAGS=n ; ATAGS obsolete 


 User perspective:  compatibility mode for DT booting

   Some bootloaders have no specific support for the Device Tree, or the version used on a particular device is too old
   to have this support.

   To ease the transition, a compatibility mechanism was added: CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB.
       It tells the kernel to look for a DTB right after the kernel image.
       There is no built-in Makefile rule to produce such kernel, so one must manually do:
            cat arch/arm/boot/zImage arch/arm/boot/dts/myboard.dtb > my-zImage
            mkimage ... -d my-zImage my-uImage
  
   In addition, the additional option CONFIG_ARM_ATAG_DTB_COMPAT tells the kernel to read the ATAGS information from the
   bootloader, and update the DT using them.
  
  
    => so for old bootloaders we need :  CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB
    ==> however not needed for the raspberry pi, it probably has bootloader supporting dtb!
     (because in build instructions for raspberry pi kernels on their website the config doesn't use CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB )

         recognize whether it is pointing to ATAGS or DT.

         from the ATAG list  -> where does it find this??  => it is passed by the old bootloader not supporting device tree!
         and store it at run time into the appended DTB.


    explanation: 
       in traditional ATAG  the bootloader passes the memory adress of ATAGS to the  kernel
   
       in new bootloaders supporting the new device tree scenario 
        the bootloader gets passed the address to the device tree and the bootloader
        sets the extra kernel arguments in the device tree. The kernel reads the device tree
        where the extra kernel arguments are already set(by bootloader.)
   
       In old bootloaders which not support device tree they still pass the memory adress of ATAGS to the  kernel.
       Then you can still use device tree by appending it after the kernel, so it can then load the device tree
       from there. The kernel also has the address to the ATAGS, and can then instead of the bootloader apply
       this data the device tree!! 
   
   => so for new bootloaders this option shouldn't be enabled!
 
   => hmm what happens with a new bootloader when this is enabled??
      
      above I already said:
        So I expect that if the kernel is passed a memory address from the bootloader it can
        recognize whether it is pointing to ATAGS or DT.
          
      so if sees it is passed a DT then it will just ignore this compatibility mode
      
      
      
so for new bootloaders 

    CONFIG_ATAGS=n  
    CONFIG_ARM_APPENDED_DTB=n
    
  => which is set as such by the raspbian default kernel configs
