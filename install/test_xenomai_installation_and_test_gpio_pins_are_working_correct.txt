test xenomai
  - commands about info  xenomai is running


      You can check if xenomai is running by running the command:

          ls /proc/xenomai

      which version with

          cat /proc/xenomai/version
  
  - Testing the real-time system 
  
    note: this test is independent of gpio -> just tests cobalt kernel for latency

       First, become root
       
         $ sudo su - 
       
       the run the latency test:

         $ /usr/xenomai/bin/latency

       If the latency test succeeds, you should try next to run the xeno-test test in order to assess the worst-case
       latency of your system. Try:

          $ /usr/xenomai/bin/xeno-test --help

         e.g. run:

          $ /usr/xenomai/sbin/autotune
            # https://www.xenomai.org/documentation/xenomai-3/html/man1/autotune/
            # autotune is a utility to determine the best calibration values (aka gravity triplet) for the core clock timer.

          $ /usr/xenomai/bin/xeno-test
            # runs latency test with dohell running

test gpio pins

 
  - command checking gpio pins are up
  
      for using gpio pins you need to have  the  "xeno_gpio_bcm2835" module to be loaded,
      you can check this with

          lsmod
      
       if not loaded then load with 
       
          modprobe xeno_gpio_bcm2835
      

       then:
          $ls /dev/rtdm/pinctrl-bcm/
           -> lists gpio0 ... gpio53 


  - try simple basic programs to check what in GPIO is not working

      requirement: 
         for this check we need the electronic scheme 
         
              circuit/combined__button_toggles_led__output_driven_irq.png
         
         which is also sed and described in 
                
              http://www.cs.ru.nl/J.Hooman/DES/XenomaiExercises/Exercise-7.html
                   

        https://github.com/harcokuppens/xenomai3_rpi_gpio/tree/master/examples/linux/wiringpi_examples

         with a xenomai patched kernel the linux based examples should also still work
          -> if something wrong with patch, then these could also break!!
  
          make
          ./blink    -> test gpio output
          ./output_driven_irq    ->  test both  gpio output and gpio interrupt (latter driven by feeding output line with voltage divider to an input port -> no switch needed, just blinking of led toggles also interrupt)
  
          ./button_toggles_led    ->  press button to toggle led  , test both interrupt from button and  output

        test gpio output :

            Exercise 7a.
               Write a program which makes the led blink on and off with a period of 500 milliseconds.

        test interupt: 
            Exercise 7b.
               Extend the program of 7a such that it counts the interrupts on the yellow line to pin 24. Print the value of the counter after each interrupt. 

            or 
    
            Exercise 7c. 
               Write a program which counts the interrupts on pin 23 caused by the switch. At each interrupt, toggle the LED on
               or off and print the value of the counter. Describe and explain the output of the program.


        final test :  run clock program!!  => should work!!
