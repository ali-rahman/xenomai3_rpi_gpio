which packages used by kernel?
search installed packages which have /boot :
  $ dpkg -S /boot
  raspberrypi-kernel, raspberrypi-bootloader,  base-files : /boot

  $ dpkg -S /boot
  ..
  raspberrypi-kernel: /boot/kernel.img
  raspberrypi-kernel: /boot/kernel7.img
  ..
  
  
then hold to that package version :

  $ apt-mark hold  raspberrypi-kernel raspberrypi-bootloader
  
  $ dpkg --get-selections | grep raspberrypi 
  ..
  raspberrypi-kernel            hold 
  raspberrypi-bootloader        hold
  ..

Raspberry Pi kernels

    The kernel for the Raspberry Pi can be found on the /boot partition (the FAT32 partition you can open on Windows, Mac and Linux).
    
    - For the Raspberry Pi 1 (B, B+, A, A+) it is called        kernel.img.
    - For the Raspberry Pi 2 (B) it is called                   kernel7.img.

    The kernel is one of the few bits of software that wasn't able to run on both the Raspberry Pi 1 CPU (ARM6) and the Raspberry Pi 2 (ARM7) with the same version.
    Instead the 2 versions had to be compiled separately and the firmware selects the correct one depending on the hardware it detects on boot. 






=> question : can I still have the same modules dir in /lib/modules ??
      => think so, think ipipe and bcm patches don't affect module code
      
      
      
    if so, we can user kernel and kernel7 trick
    however we still need also different xenomai user space utils because rpi1 is single core and rpi2/3 is multicore
      => but that is xenomai specific and rpi couldn't forsee that, but we can set in ~/.bashrc the right
         kernel path depending on value in /proc/device-tree/model  .... hmm /proc/cpu is maybe easier
          to grep on bcm type
