          slightly faster CPU,
          bluetooth 4.2 (ipv 4.1),
          also support 1000 Mbit network

          new : power over ethernet support
      
    beide:   
      
      CPU 	ARM Cortex-A53 (ARMv8-A) 	  => only differ in clock speed!!

    BCM2837B0  (CPU,GPU, GPIO,USB,UART,I2C,PWM)
      The new product is built around BCM2837B0:
         an UPDATED version of the 64-bit Broadcom application processor  used in Raspberry Pi 3B, 
         which incorporates:
             power integrity optimisations, and a heat spreader (that’s the shiny metal
             bit you can see in the photos). Together these allow us to reach higher clock frequencies (or to run at lower
             voltages to reduce power consumption), and to more accurately monitor and control the temperature of the chip.
             
             => don't think GPIO is changed!!

              BCM2835 => contains both ARM chip and GPU!!
      
              BCM2835 contains the following peripherals which may safely be accessed by the ARM:
              • Timers
              • Interrupt controller
              • GPIO
              • USB
              • PCM / I2S
              • DMA controller
              • I2C master
              • I2C / SPI slave
              • SPI0, SPI1, SPI2
              • PWM
              • UART0, UART1
       
              The purpose of this datasheet is to provide documentation for these peripherals in sufficient detail to allow a developer to port an operating system to BCM2835.
              There are a number of peripherals which are intended to be controlled by the GPU. These are omitted from this datasheet. Accessing these peripherals from the ARM is not recommended.

             ARM CPU/GPU -- This is a Broadcom BCM2835 System on a Chip (SoC) that's made up of an ARM central processing unit
             (CPU) and a Videocore 4 graphics processing unit (GPU). The CPU handles all the computations that make a computer
             work (taking input, doing calculations and producing output), and the GPU handles graphics output.
    
           


    Cypress CYW43455 “combo” chip ( WLAN, Bluetooth)
        Dual-band wireless LAN and Bluetooth are provided by the Cypress CYW43455 “combo” chip, connected to a Proant
        PCB antenna similar to the one used on Raspberry Pi Zero W. Compared to its predecessor, Raspberry Pi 3B+
        delivers somewhat better performance in the 2.4GHz band, and far better performance in the 5GHz band, as
        demonstrated by these iperf results from LibreELEC developer Milhouse.
    
    LAN7515  (ethernet controller, usb hub)

          ,->wrong  rpi2b,and 3b have LAN9514
       The LAN7514 chip which has acted as the USB hub and as the Ethernet Controller for the Pi since the Model B+ was
       released back in 2014, has been replaced by the LAN7515.
                                                        `-> rpi 3b+
    => mainly 3 chips!
