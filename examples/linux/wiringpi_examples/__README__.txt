WiringPi is a PIN based GPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835 used in
the Raspberry Pi. Itâ€™s released under the GNU LGPLv3 license and is usable from
C, C++ and RTB (BASIC) as well as many other languages with suitable wrappers.

WiringPi includes a command-line utility "gpio" which can be used to program and
setup the GPIO pins. You can use this to read and write the pins and even use it
to control them from shell scripts.

The documentation of the gpio utility is  at:
