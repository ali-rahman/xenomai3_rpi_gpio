Why is the CPU sometimes referred to as BCM2708, sometimes BCM2835?

	

   I've seen the System on Chip of Raspberry Pi referred to usually as "BCM2835" (e.g. on Wikipedia), 
   but sometimes as "BCM2708" (e.g. sources for Linux SPI driver are in bcm2708.c)     => cat /proc/cpuinfo  says bcm2708


short answer :

  - three pieces of silicon, BCM2708, BCM2709 and BCM2710              => family   => linux driver and  'cat /proc/cpuinfo'  says bcm2708
                                ||      ||         ||
  - and three packages       BCM2835, BCM2836 and BCM2837              => specific implementation (however per family only one implementation)
                                                 
                               pi1       pi2       pi2.1
                                                   pi3  
                                                   
    TIP: lower number is family (27) higher number is specific implementation (28)

answer 1:

    Actually the discrepancy is due to the designation of the silicon and the chip package. Originally there was the
    silicon die which is known as BCM2708, all initial development was done around this.

    In a stacked 9x9 package with 256M of DRAM it is then known as BCM2763. 
           `=> Stacked is when you literally bond the DRAM silicon on top of the processor and put bond wires down onto the substrate

    But when the memory is POP'd (package on package, the DRAM package is attached to the top of the processor package)
    then it was known as BCM2835, this is the device that then had the ARM enabled.

    Later versions of the chip follow the same scheme, there are now 
      - three pieces of silicon, BCM2708, BCM2709 and BCM2710              => family
      - and three packages       BCM2835, BCM2836 and BCM2837              => specific implementation (however per family only one implementation)
                                   pi1       pi2       pi2.1
                                                       pi3
                                                       
answer 2 :


    there is a discussion here on the git hub issue log for linux drivers discussing how the drivers should be labeled. 
    The pertinent posts are:

   

        Technically 2708 is the family, and 2835 is a specific implementation. We now know that 2835 is the only
        implementation in the family that can run linux, (and there won't be new models of this family), so it probably
        doesn't matter which model is used, although it should be consistent.

        So it would be reasonable to name all the drivers 2708 but the specific device tree file 2835.
