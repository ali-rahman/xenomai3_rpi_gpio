how to easily setup the connection between a rpi and a laptop in the lab 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

requirements:
 - must be easy and quick (no configuration hassle)
 - we want a single image for all raspberry pi's  => no unique hostnames on the pi's
 
 
 
 
investigate solutions: 
 
 1) use zeroconf  when directly connecting the rpi and laptop using an utp cable 
          `-> automatically configure network connection 
     
     => see : /home/harcok/doc/help/systeembeheer/services/netwerk_tcpip/connect_two_computers_directly_via_utp/zeroconf_solution.txt
          
     => uses
        zeroconf's IPv4LL address resolution : fetch automatically  169.x.x.x  link-local ip address
        zeroconf's : mDNS name resolution :  <hostname>.local -> link-local ip addres 
     
         see: /home/harcok/doc/help/systeembeheer/services/netwerk_tcpip/zeroconf.txt
         
         
     You don't need a cross-over cable:
       http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16040128/hook-up-raspberry-pi-via-ethernet-to-laptop-without-router
       You don't need a cross-over cable. You can use a normal network cable since the Raspberry Pi LAN chip is smart enough
       to reconfigure itself for direct network connections. Cheers

     
     
    disadvantages: 
       -> not all laptops have utp connector anymore, so they must have an utp adapter
       -> zeroconf per os still different, so compatibility problems between different os's occur  
          eg. for windows you need to install "bonjour for windows for printing services" to get mDNS running!        
       -> zeroconf IPv4LL for linux not always by default activate as fallback when dhcp fails       
       -> each rpi needs different hostname => images should vary!!
       

     SEE: direct_connection_between_pc_rpi.txt   
          => here we use static local link resolution  so that pi always has same IP  => convenient!!
              `-> zeroconf not needed => setup is static!!
          => don't use <hostname>.local but just fixed IP for pi!!
               -> so using same image for every pi is no problem!!
                  
         ONE problem remains :
            not all laptops have utp connector anymore, so they must have an utp adapter
 
 
2) use zeroconf on same local (WIFI) network:   
         `-> automatically configure network connection 
     => uses
        zeroconf's IPv4LL address resolution : fetch automatically  169.x.x.x  link-local ip address
        zeroconf's : mDNS name resolution :  <hostname>.local -> link-local ip addres 

        see: /home/harcok/doc/help/systeembeheer/services/netwerk_tcpip/zeroconf.txt

      both pc and rpi are connected to same local network 
      then zeroconf lets you access rpi by its hostname
      Disadadvantages
       -> zeroconf per os still different, so compatibility problems between different os's occur  
          eg. for windows you need to install "bonjour for windows for printing services" to get mDNS running!        
       -> zeroconf IPv4LL for linux not always by default activate as fallback when dhcp fails                                
       -> each rpi needs different hostname => images should vary!!
       -> both need on same local network => so laptop must also on same local network
          note: if using wifi we could use our own wifi local network ( because  bringing rpi3 on eduroam requires account!! )

 3) use dynamic dns  on same local (WIFI) network:                                                               
       problem: using external dyndns server requires that each image different

      SOLUTION:  "own dns server"
         however by making my own dns server and some batch scripts I
         can make each image the same and using its own specific mac address
         publish its ip address. Which other pc's can easily fetch with
         other bash scripts
          => see ../../install/dyndns/
              implemented a simple dyndns server in php which uses the pi's unique mac-address
              to register its ip  =>  same image can be used for many pi's !!
  
       => no problems left!!
         even using wifi is much easier , no utp cable connection needed!!
         
          note: direct link over utp cable is more interesting when needing a  fast connection for file copying!
                but in our case we don't need that.
          
         
  
solution 3 used in lab:   (no zeroconf needed, because for zeroconf we still need unique hostname's per pi! => different images!)
------------------------
  - wifi router providing wireless local 192 network with simple password (product name of router in lab)
  - which does NAT to give local clients access to outside network,
  - however they are not addressable from the outside which means:
      * clients are safe from outside attacks
      * to communicate from laptop/pc with pi, the laptop/pc must also be on
        local wifi network (not eduroam)
  - use my own dyndns php server script : http://cs.ru.nl/lab/dyndns/index.php
    to let users find ip-address of a pi using its mac-address
    note:
      * pi subscribes  mac-address->ip-address to this server on every boot
      * on pi is sticker which says what is mac address is
    => so pi doesn't need to be connected to a monitor or utp cable
       it only  needs power, and then it automatically connects to local wifi
       network and publish its ip on the dyndns server so it can be easily be
       access by other machines on the same local wifi network
