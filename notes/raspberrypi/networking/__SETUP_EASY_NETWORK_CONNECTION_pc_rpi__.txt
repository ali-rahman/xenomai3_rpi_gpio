PREFER:  "own dns server" solution below



simplest solution:
 
  direct_connection_between_pc_rpi.txt   


alternatives are by using network:
 * use dynamic dns
       problem: using external dyndns server requires that each image different

       solution:  "own dns server"
         however by making my own dns server and some batch scripts I
         can make each image the same and using its own specific mac address
         publish its ip address. Which other pc's can easily fetch with
         other bash scripts
          => see ../../install/dyndns/
              implemented a simple dyndns server in php which uses the pi's unique mac-address
              to register its ip  =>  same image can be used for many pi's !!
         
 
 * use zeroconf : both pc and rpi are connected to same local network 
                  then zeroconf lets you access rpi by its hostname
                  Disadadvantages:
                   -> each rpi needs different hostname => images should vary!!
                   -> both need on same local network => so no eduroam connect laptops
                      note: bringing rpi3 on eduroam requires account!!
