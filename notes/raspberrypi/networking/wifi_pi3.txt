The quickest way to enable wireless networking is to use the command line raspi-config tool.

     sudo raspi-config

Select the Network Options item from the menu, then the Wi-fi option. On a fresh install, for regulatory purposes, you will need to specify the
country in which the device is being used. Then set the SSID of the network, and the passphrase for the network. If you do not know the SSID of the
network you want to connect to, see the next section on how to list available networks prior to running raspi-config.

Note that raspi-config does not provide a complete set of options for setting up wireless networking; you may need to refer to the extra sections
below for more details if raspi-config fails to connect the Pi to your requested network.



To scan for WiFi networks, use the command 

   sudo iwlist wlan0 scan
   
This will list all available WiFi networks, along with other useful information. Look out for:

    'ESSID:"testing"' is the name of the WiFi network.
    'IE: IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 Version 1' is the authentication used. 
    
In this case it's WPA2, the newer and more secure wireless standard which replaces WPA. This guide should work for WPA or WPA2, but may not work for
WPA2 enterprise. For WEP hex keys, see the last example here. You'll also need the password for the wireless network. For most home routers, this is
found on a sticker on the back of the router. The ESSID (ssid) for the examples below is testing and the password (psk) is testingPassword.

Adding the network details to the Raspberry Pi

   Open the wpa-supplicant configuration file in nano:
 
       sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

    Go to the bottom of the file and add the following:

        network={
            ssid="testing"
            psk="testingPassword"
        }


Hidden networks

    If you are using a hidden network, an extra option in the wpa_supplicant file, scan_ssid, may help connection.

    network={
        ssid="yourHiddenSSID"
        scan_ssid=1                    <== needed!!
        psk="Your_wifi_password"
    }


commands: 

Reconfigure the interface with 

  wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure

iwconfig wlan0
ifconfig wlan0


ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 up 

 wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconnect
 wpa_cli -i wlan0 disconnect

systemctl restart wpa_supplicant.servic

/etc/init.d/networking restart

ifconfig
iwconfig  
ip link set wlan0 up
  
  
https://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#Command_Line    => does not work on pi

      Find your wireless interface and bring it up:

          # ip a
          # iwconfig
          # ip link set wlan0 up

      Scan for available networks and get network details:

          $ su
          # iwlist scan

      Now edit /etc/network/interfaces. The required configuration is much dependent on your particular setup. See the following example to get an
      idea of how it works:

          # my wifi device
          auto wlan0
          iface wlan0 inet dhcp
                  wireless-essid [ESSID]
                  wireless-mode [MODE] 

      For further information on available configuration options, see man interfaces, man wireless and /usr/share/doc/wireless-tools/README.Debian.

      You can now bring your interface up and down with the usual ifup and ifdown commands. If you added auto wlan0 as in the example above, the
      interface should be brought up automatically during boot up.

        Configuring WiFi connection

        Open up the wpa_supplicant.conf file in the editor.

        $ sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

        Again, some lines might already be present, just add the following.

            network={
            ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
            psk="YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD"
            proto=RSN
            key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
            pairwise=CCMP
            auth_alg=OPEN
            }

        The other parameters are network specific, I can't tell you what you need. If you boot Raspbian to desktop, you can launc the wpa_gui (WiFi config) application and click 'Scan'. You'll find a list that has your network too with all flags you need. To do this on a RPi A you'll have to disconnect your keyboard and connect your dongle once the scanning list is open.

            proto
                could be either RSN (WPA2) or WPA (WPA1).
            key_mgmt 
                could be either WPA-PSK (most probably) or WPA-EAP (enterprise networks)
            pairwise 
                could be either CCMP (WPA2) or TKIP (WPA1)
            auth_alg 
                is most probably OPEN, other options are LEAP and SHARED

          escape strange chars in password :
          
            You escape a character by adding a '\' before it, so for example if your key was:

               P@ssword"!

            You would escape it like:

               P\@ssword\"\!

            Likewise, if you needed the character \ in your password, you would escape it by prefixing like \\.

          scan for wifi networks:  sudo iwlist wlan0 scan

          If you are using a hidden network, an extra option in the wpa_supplicant file, 
          
               scan_ssid
          
          may help connection.
          
          
          
          wpa-supplicant will normally notice within a few seconds that a change has occurred, and it will try and
          connect to the network. If it does not, 
          
          restart the interface with 
          
              sudo wpa_cli reconfigure

          You can verify whether it has successfully connected using 
          
             ifconfig wlan0
          
          If the inet addr field has an address beside it, the Raspberry Pi has connected to the network.

          On the command line you can use 
          
           * iwconfig 
                Displays status wireless connection.
                Look in output for "Link Quality" and "Signal level" values
        
                When walking around with a netbook I often use this command which updates the output of iwconfig every second:

                   watch -n1 iwconfig
        
           *  wavemon
                 Console app with color display and lots of easy to read information.
                (apt-get install wavemon)
