        Configuring WiFi connection

        Open up the wpa_supplicant.conf file in the editor.

        $ sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

        Again, some lines might already be present, just add the following.

            network={
            ssid="YOUR_NETWORK_NAME"
            psk="YOUR_NETWORK_PASSWORD"
            proto=RSN
            key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
            pairwise=CCMP
            auth_alg=OPEN
            }

        The other parameters are network specific, I can't tell you what you need. If you boot Raspbian to desktop, you can launc the wpa_gui (WiFi config) application and click 'Scan'. You'll find a list that has your network too with all flags you need. To do this on a RPi A you'll have to disconnect your keyboard and connect your dongle once the scanning list is open.

            proto
                could be either RSN (WPA2) or WPA (WPA1).
            key_mgmt 
                could be either WPA-PSK (most probably) or WPA-EAP (enterprise networks)
            pairwise 
                could be either CCMP (WPA2) or TKIP (WPA1)
            auth_alg 
                is most probably OPEN, other options are LEAP and SHARED

          escape strange chars in password :
          
            You escape a character by adding a '\' before it, so for example if your key was:

               P@ssword"!

            You would escape it like:

               P\@ssword\"\!

            Likewise, if you needed the character \ in your password, you would escape it by prefixing like \\.

           example for WPA2 :
        
        
           /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf:

               ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
               update_config=1

               network={
               ssid="replace_with_your_ssid"
               psk="replace_with_your_password"
               proto=RSN
               key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
               pairwise=CCMP
               group=CCMP
               auth_alg=OPEN
               }

          scan for wifi networks:  sudo iwlist wlan0 scan    
          config file:  /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf .

          If you are using a hidden network, an extra option in the wpa_supplicant file, 
          
               scan_ssid, 
          
          may help connection.
          
          
          
          wpa-supplicant will normally notice within a few seconds that a change has occurred, and it will try and
          connect to the network. If it does not, 
          
          restart the interface with 
          
              sudo wpa_cli reconfigure.

          You can verify whether it has successfully connected using 
          
             ifconfig wlan0
          
          If the inet addr field has an address beside it, the Raspberry Pi has connected to the network.

          On the command line you can use 
          
           * iwconfig 
                Displays status wireless connection.
                Look in output for "Link Quality" and "Signal level" values
        
                When walking around with a netbook I often use this command which updates the output of iwconfig every second:

                   watch -n1 iwconfig
        
           *  wavemon
                 Console app with color display and lots of easy to read information.
                (apt-get install wavemon)
