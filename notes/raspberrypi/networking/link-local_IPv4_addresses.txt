Link-local IPv4 addresses  (169.254.x.x)
=========================

    http://www.wikiwand.com/en/IP_address#/Address_autoconfiguration
    
         When the link-local IPv4 address block was reserved, no standards existed for mechanisms of address
         autoconfiguration. Filling the void, Microsoft created an implementation that is called Automatic Private IP
         Addressing (APIPA). APIPA has been deployed on millions of machines and has, thus, become a de facto standard
         in the industry. In RFC 3927, the IETF defined a formal standard for this functionality, entitled Dynamic
         Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local Addresses.

      Most IPv4 hosts use link-local addressing only as a last resort when a DHCP server is unavailable. 
      => zeroconf first tries other ways such as dhcp, but if those fail it fails back to link-local

     

     There are some link-local IPv4 address implementations available:

         Apple Mac OS and MS Windows have supported link-local addresses since 1998.[citation needed] Apple released its open-source implementation in the Darwin bootp package.
         Avahi contains an implementation of IPv4LL in the avahi-autoipd tool.
         Zero-Conf IP (zcip).[32]
         BusyBox can embed a simple IPv4LL implementation.
         Stablebox,[33] a fork from Busybox, offers a slightly modified IPv4LL implementation named llad.
         Zeroconf,[34] a package based on Simple IPv4LL, a shorter implementation by Arthur van Hoff.[35]

     The above implementations are all stand-alone daemons or plugins for DHCP clients that only deal with link-local
     IP addresses. Another approach is to include support in new or existing DHCP clients:

           Elvis PfÃ¼tzenreuter has written a patch for the uDHCP client/server.[36]
       ->  dhcpcd[37] is an opensource DHCP client for Linux and BSD that includes IPv4LL support. 
          It is included as standard in NetBSD.
            
            
            
          => rasbpian uses "dhcpcd"

            ipv6
       
                The IPv6 equivalent to what we know as "Private IPv4 addresses" is known as Unique Local Addresses (ULA):

                    src: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4193
                    This document defines an IPv6 unicast address format that is globally unique and is intended for 
                    local communications, usually inside of a site. These addresses are not expected to be routable on
                    the global Internet.
       
       
                HOWEVER, if there is going to be something NATed in IPv6 (despite best practices), it would be a ULA address to
                a Global address. It surely won't be link-local address space.
       
       
            ipv4 
                Link-Local addresses (FE80::/10) exists only for local network communication... aka, you communicating with your
                neighbor, and potentially your router. It is, by definition, not meant to be used to speak to anything on the
                other side of a router. As such, intrinsincly, you should never come across or try to NAT a Link-Local address
                to a Global address.
         
                 see: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927
                 This document describes how a host may
                    automatically configure an interface with an IPv4 address within the
                    169.254/16 prefix that is valid for communication with other devices
                    connected to the same physical (or logical) link.


                 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3927#section-7
                        7.  Router Considerations

                           A router MUST NOT forward a packet with an IPv4 Link-Local source or
                           destination address, irrespective of the router's default route
                           configuration or routes obtained from dynamic routing protocols.

                           A router which receives a packet with an IPv4 Link-Local source or
                           destination address MUST NOT forward the packet.  This prevents
                           forwarding of packets back onto the network segment from which they
                           originated, or to any other segment.

         dhcpcd
            a DHCP and DHCPv6 client. It's also an IPv4LL (aka ZeroConf) client.    
            
            
            In layman's terms, dhcpcd runs on your machine and silently configures your computer to work on the
            attached networks without trouble and mostly without configuration.
            


used as fallback
----------------

  https://4sysops.com/archives/ipv6-tutorial-part-6-site-local-addresses-and-link-local-addresses/

  Whenever automatic IP configuration through DHCP fails, Windows automatically assigns an autoconfiguration address in
  the range 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254, which allows the computer to communicate with other machines on the link.

   see: https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc778502%28v=ws.10%29.aspx
 
  
 => linux does the same  
      * dhcpcd.conf even has an option to modify the exact fallback profile
