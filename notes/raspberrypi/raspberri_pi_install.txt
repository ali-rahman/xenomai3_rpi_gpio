raspberri pi
============


=> just goto https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/
   and download an image you like
=> for course I prefer minimal install,
   because minimal image :
     - in course don't need desktop  => just need terminal
     - is smaller image to download and install
     - boots faster because doesn't start desktop


custom MINIMAL install tips
---------------------------

 - minimal raspbian install + remove package  + zero out unused diskspace to make virt.box image smaller (sfill)

emulate rpi with qemu
--------------------- 
   => note: arm not supported by virtualbox so must use qemu
