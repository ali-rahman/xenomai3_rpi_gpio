     3.3V Output

      External circuitry may draw up to a total of 50mA max current from the 3.3V Out pins (true for Model B so
      presumably true for Model B+ but not confirmed as full schematic not yet available).

       Is maximum current from 3.3V pin really 50mA?

    IO Pins

      All IO pins are 3.3V, not 1.8V.  Pins are not 5V tolerant.

        => very good!!

    Power-up State

        Its likely all pins are set as inputs on power up (TBC).

        I2C pins (e.g. Pj-3 and P8-5) are therefore high due to the pull up resistors on these pins.

   Pull-Up & Pull-Down resistors

        The GPIO ports include the ability to enable and disable internal pull-up or pull-down resistors from code.

        Pull-up is 50K min – 65K max.
         see: http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pull-up_resistor

        Pull-down is 50K min – 60K max. 

       

    I2C

        1K8 pull up resistors are included on the RPi board so are not needed externally (true for Model B so
        presumably true for Model B+ but not confirmed as full schematic not yet available).

        Interfacing the RPi 3.3V I2C pins to a 5V device like an Arduino – see here.

    SPI

        The Chip Select signals are for up to two independent slave devices. It seems that with the SPI port enabled in
        Raspbian both the CS0 and CS1 pins are assigned to it and therefore can't be used as IO (our assumption –
        correct?)


    PWM Pin

        The PWM pin available on the GPIO header is shared with the Audio system (true for Model B so presumably true
        for Model B+ – not confirmed as full schematic not yet available). This means that you can't use the PWM output
        and play audio through the 3.5mm jack at the same time.
