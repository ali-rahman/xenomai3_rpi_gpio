raspbian version
-----------------


https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=12471&p=134909

Raspbian doesn't really have a version in the traditional sense. Rather, Raspbian is a rebuild of the Debian Wheezy
armhf repository and the 1000's of packages that comprise the repository are updated from time to time. The more
pertinent question is whether your install of Raspbian (or rather the packages that comprise your install of Raspbian)
is up to date. The best way of keeping Raspbian up to date with the latest packages is to periodically run the
following commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

Different Raspbian images in the past are created against whatever packages were in the repository at that time.
Running the two commands above will upgrade all installations of Raspbian to the latest packages no matter what image
the original install was done from.

  You can check the release of Raspbian, simply reading the content of the
  os-release file. Or you can install lsb-release package and then run it to get
  the version of the operating system. Instead, if you want to know the Kernel
  version in your Raspberry Pi, you can use the uname command.

    $ cat /etc/os-release
