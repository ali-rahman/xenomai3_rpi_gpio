First, update your system's package list by entering the following command:

   sudo apt-get update

Next, upgrade all your installed packages to their latest versions with the command:

   sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

Generally speaking, doing this regularly will keep your installation up to date, in that it will be equivalent to the
latest released image available from raspberrypi.org/downloads.


Updating the kernel and firmware

   The kernel and firmware are installed as a Debian package, and so will also get updates when using the procedure
   above. These packages are updated infrequently and after extensive testing.


Running out of space

    When running sudo apt-get dist-upgrade, it will show how much data will be downloaded and how much space it will take
    up on the SD card. It's worth checking with df -h that you have enough free disk space, as unfortunately apt will not
    do this for you. Also be aware that downloaded package files (.deb files) are kept in /var/cache/apt/archives. You can
    remove these in order to free up space with 

       sudo apt-get clean.

Updating to Raspbian with PIXEL

  The PIXEL desktop ships with the new Raspbian image file. Raspbian with PIXEL is available at the Raspberry Pi
  downloads page. Itâ€™s also possible to update a current Raspbian Jessie installation using these commands:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
    sudo apt-get install -y rpi-chromium-mods
    sudo apt-get install -y python-sense-emu python3-sense-emu python-sense-emu-doc

    Firmware: is a small package of code that usually lives on a special chip of a computer that helps 
               the software know how to talk to the hardware. 
               However, in the case of the Raspberry Pi, the firmware will live on the first partition of the SD card.
        => /boot partition

    Raspbian: is an operating system or the core software for your Raspberry Pi. 
              Software (including the OS) lives on second partition of the SD card and is all the 
              stuff that gets executed when you use your device.
        => / partition

  rpi-update: is a tool to upgrade the firmware for your Raspberry Pi.
  
  rpi-update not needed anymore: 
     Meanwhile the kernel is part of the raspberrypi-kernel package in Raspbian.
     So rpi-update is not needed anymore to update the kernel.
      -> so new kernel installed by installing new version of raspberrypi-kernel package
