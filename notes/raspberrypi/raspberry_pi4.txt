Ethernet Controller

    The Broadcom BCM54213 Gigabit ethernet controller is a…
    “Triple-speed 1000BASE-T/100BASE-TX/10BASE-T Energy Efficient Ethernet (IEEE 802.3az) Gigabit (GbE) transceivers integrated into a single monolithic CMOS chip.”

    It handles the Gigabit ethernet connection but can fall back to slower speeds if connected to slower networks. A
    big step-change in the Pi4 generation is that the I/O from this chip is no longer ‘herded’ through a shared USB
    channel on the main processor. It’s been done ‘properly’ so now works at full Gigabit speed. This makes the Pi4
    much more useful than previous generations for use cases such as…

        a software driven router
        a media server
        a bridge between WiFi and ethernet networks


USB Controller

    The VL805 chip is the controller for the 2 x USB 3.0 and 2 x USB 2.0 ports.

vraag:
   Haalt de Pi4 de volledige throughput van USB3.0 én Gigabit Ethernet? 
   I.p.v. dit weer op de USB2.0 bus te hebben zitten.

antwoord:  Ze zitten beiden op een aparte controller, waardoor dat geen probleem meer is. Zie:
   
    The Ethernet controller on the main SoC is connected to an external Broadcom PHY over a dedicated RGMII link,
    providing full throughput. USB is provided via an external VLI controller, connected over a single PCI Express Gen
    2 lane, and providing a total of 4Gbps of bandwidth, shared between the four ports.
