What does edge triggered and level triggered mean?

  Its exactlly what is says.

  If edge interrupt is set, the ISR will only get fired on falling/rising edge of a pulse. While if level sensitive
  interrupt (as you say) is set the ISR will get fired everytime there is a low-level/high-level signal on the
  corresponding pin.

  In short, edge interrupt gets fired only on changing edges, while level interrupts gets fired as long as the pulse is
  low or high.

  So if you have low-level interrupt set, MCU will keep executing the ISR as long as the pin is low.
  
  ==> That is, it will leave and re-enter the ISR again and again, as long as the pin is low.

 from keyboard_irq_sharing_xenomai_linux_eoi__discussion_on_xenomai_mailinglist.txt :
                  
    For level-triggered IRQs, all hardware devices that may have raised the
    IRQ line must be checked and told to lower it again before sending EOI.                    

  => for some devices this is not possible. Eg. the led sensor for the pendulum clock stays low as long the pendulum
    passes the sensor  =>   you need the use edge-trigger interrupt instead!!
