realtime gpio - xenomai RTDM gpio driver
----------------------------------------

 in xenomai3 project at git : http://git.xenomai.org/xenomai-3.git/
 there is a work in progress drivers branch (wip/drivers): http://git.xenomai.org/xenomai-3.git/log/?h=wip/drivers

 Which contains a beta version of a rtdm driver for each gpio port :
   
   in xenomai  source :
       include/rtdm/gpio.h
       include/rtdm/uapi/gpio.h
       
    $ ls -1 kernel/drivers/gpio/
    gpio-bcm2835.c                      => realtime (RTDM) driver for bcm2835's gpio (raspberry pi)  => uses generic gpio-core.c library to implement it
    gpio-core.c                         => realtime (RTDM) gpio library to implement gpiochip drivers in realtime
    gpio-core.h
    gpio-mxc.c                          => driver for mxc's gpio (NOT raspberry pi)
    Kconfig                             => config parameters for linux kernel (whether to build into kernel or not)
    Makefile   

     =>  kernel space source code!!!
     

IMPORTANT: 

* see 
  
     RTDM_driver_for_gpio_ports_on_bcm2835_chip.txt 

  for details of the implementation of the realtime (RTDM) driver for bcm2835's gpio

* the realtime library implemented in gpio-core.c wraps a gpiochip in an rtdm driver, but when 
  doing this it only supports realtime for read and write file operations
  but not for ioctl and open. For ioctl and open the program will return to linux prioritiy!!
