in program clock with text: sometimes the next alarm is programmed before the previous alarm
      => in theory rt_alarm_start should reprogram previous alarm

          rt_alarm_start()
            Start an alarm.

            This routine programs the trigger date of an alarm object.
            
            This service overrides any previous setup of the expiry date and reload interval for the alarm.
                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
             
          rt_alarm_stop()
             int rt_alarm_stop 	( 	RT_ALARM *  	alarm	) 	

             Stop an alarm.

             This routine disables an alarm object, preventing any further expiry until it is re-enabled via rt_alarm_start().            
                         
      =>  but something goes wrong with  rt_alarm_start
          we suddenly get many alarms   => program crashes
        
        
        
      fix : do rt_alarm_stop  before each rt_alarm_start
            I guess overriding with rt_alarm_start is BUGGY, so you better can first stop it completely and restart it!
