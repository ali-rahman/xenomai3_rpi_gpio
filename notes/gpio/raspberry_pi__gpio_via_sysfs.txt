  Paths in Sysfs
  --------------
  
  There are three kinds of entries in /sys/class/gpio:

     -	Control interfaces used to get userspace control over GPIOs;

     -	GPIOs themselves; and

     -	GPIO controllers ("gpio_chip" instances).
  
  
  The control interfaces are write-only:

      /sys/class/gpio/

      	"export" ... Userspace may ask the kernel to export control of
  		a GPIO to userspace by writing its number to this file.


      	"unexport" ... Reverses the effect of exporting to userspace.


  	Examples:  
    
        "echo 19 > /sys/class/gpio/export" 
           will create a "gpio19" nodefor GPIO #19, if that's not requested by kernel code.

  		"echo 19 > /sys/class/gpio/unexport" 
           will remove a "gpio19" node exported using the "export" file.

    you can also use the gpio command coming with the wiringpi library 
    to give /sys/class/gpio mode commands
   
         $ gpio -g export 19  in 
         $ gpio exports
         GPIO pins exported:
           19: in 
         $ gpio -g  unexport 19
         $ gpio unexportall
         
     note:  The optional -g flag causes pin numbers to be interpreted as BCM_GPIO pin numbers rather than standard wiringPi pin numbers.
      
         $ gpio readall
          
          => reads all pins and shows their numbering!  (gpio pin numbers are on outer column)
