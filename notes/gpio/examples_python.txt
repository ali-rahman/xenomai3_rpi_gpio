            GPIO mode checking with GPIO.getmode()

        Software PWM

        From 0.5.2a onwards, RPi.GPIO has software PWM. Below are two links. One describes its basic usage and the other is a practical application for dimming LEDs and controlling motor speed.

            PWM: RPi.GPIO 0.5.2a now has software PWM – How to use it
            PWM practical: How to use soft PWM in RPi.GPIO 0.5.2a pt 2 – led dimming and motor speed control
