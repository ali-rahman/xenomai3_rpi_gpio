          Five of the 17 available GPIO lines are pulled high by default (the rest are pulled low). 
          The numbers are GPIO0/2, GPIO1/3, GPIO4, GPIO7 and GPIO8.
      
          GPIO14
            As I learned from the forums, I use an LED hooked up to GPIO14 and mounted on my chassis to notify me when the
            pi has completely shut down (The LED is lit at boot and is turned off at shutdown after the files systems have
            been unmounted.

          The power on state is defined in BCM2835 ARM Peripherals page 102.

          Basically all GPIO are in INPUT mode, GPIO 0-8 have pull-ups to 3V3 enabled, GPIO 9-27 have pull-downs to 0V enabled.
      

fix:  
-----



add to  /etc/rc.local  :


    # by default turn clock leds off (clock exercise)
    # leds are connected to gpio pins 2 3 4 17 27 22 10 9
    echo "$prefix set output value 0 on gpio pins  2 3 4 17  27 22 10 9"
    for d in 2 3 4 17 27 22 10 9
    do
      gpio -g mode $d out
      gpio -g write $d 0
    done
