pinctrl subsystem in linux
===========================

from: raspberry_pi__gpio_memory_mapping.txt 
  - you can low level read/write memory to control gpio ports
  - however pinctrl library in linux helps you to do this more easily


https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/pinctrl.txt


the pin control subsystem in Linux

 Pinctrl is framework provided in the kernel for accessing PIN's
 
 
 Definition of PIN CONTROLLER:

 - A pin controller is a piece of hardware, usually a set of registers, that
   can control PINs. It may be able to multiplex, bias, set load capacitance,
   set drive strength, etc. for individual pins or groups of pins.
 
 
 
=> pinctrl helps you drive a pin controller instead of doing all memory mapped IO yourself!!
 
 
 
 for gpio pins of the bcm2835 chip a special pinctrl driver(drives specific pin controller) is ready available using
 the pinctrl framework :
  
   ./drivers/pinctrl/bcm/pinctrl-bcm2835.c  
        uses pinctrl framework to implement a gpiochip ( standard interface you need to implement for gpio chip)
