https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysfs


During the 2.5 development cycle, the Linux driver model was introduced to fix several shortcomings of version 2.4:

    No unified method of representing driver-device relationships existed.
    There was no generic hotplug mechanism.
    procfs was cluttered with non-process information.

Sysfs was designed to export the information present in the device tree which would then no longer clutter up procfs. 

sysfs is a pseudo file system provided by the Linux kernel that exports information about 
- various kernel subsystems, 
- hardware devices, 
- and associated device drivers 
from the kernel's device model to user space through virtual files.[1] In addition to providing information about various devices and
kernel subsystems, 

    exported virtual files are also used for their configuration.

sysfs provides functionality similar to the sysctl mechanism found in BSD operating systems, with the difference that sysfs is implemented as a
virtual file system instead of being a purpose-built kernel mechanism, and that, in Linux, sysctl configuration parameters are made available at
/proc/sys/ as part of procfs, not sysfs which is mounted at /sys/.[2]



 Manual driver binding and unbinding
 ===================================

   Manual driver binding and unbinding
  
  
  
   In the sysfs tree, every driver now has bind and unbind files associated with it:

       $ tree /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ub/
       /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ub/
       |-- 1-1:1.0 -> ../../../../devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.0
       |-- bind
       |-- module -> ../../../../module/ub
       `-- unbind

   In order to unbind a device from a driver, simply write the bus id of the device to the unbind file:

       echo -n "1-1:1.0" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ub/unbind

   and the device will no longer be bound to the driver:

       $ tree /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ub/
       /sys/bus/usb/drivers/ub/
       |-- bind
       |-- module -> ../../../../module/ub
       `-- unbind

   To bind a device to a driver, the device must first not be controlled by any other driver. 
   To ensure this, look for the "driver" symlink in the device directory:

       $ tree /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1:1.0
       /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1:1.0
       |-- bAlternateSetting
       |-- bInterfaceClass
       |-- bInterfaceNumber
       |-- bInterfaceProtocol
       |-- bInterfaceSubClass
       |-- bNumEndpoints
       |-- bus -> ../../../../../../bus/usb
       |-- modalias
       `-- power
           `-- state
  
       ok => no "driver" entry listed
       
    Then, simply write the bus id of the device you wish to bind, into the bind file for that driver:

       echo -n "1-1:1.0" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb-storage/bind

   And check that the binding was successful:

       $ tree /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1:1.0
       /sys/bus/usb/devices/1-1:1.0
       |-- bAlternateSetting
       |-- bInterfaceClass
       |-- bInterfaceNumber
       |-- bInterfaceProtocol
       |-- bInterfaceSubClass
       |-- bNumEndpoints
       |-- bus -> ../../../../../../bus/usb
       |-- driver -> ../../../../../../bus/usb/drivers/usb-storage          => yes driver attached to device
       |-- host2
       |   `-- power
       |       `-- state
       |-- modalias
       `-- power
           `-- state
  


    As the example above shows, this capability is very useful for switching devices between drivers which handle the
    same type of device (both the ub and usb-storage drivers handle USB mass storage devices, like flash drives.)
   
   
    => only one driver per device!!
   
  


Injecting events into hotplug via "uevent":         src:  https://www.kernel.org/doc/pending/hotplug.txt
===========================================

    Events can be injected into the hotplug mechanism through sysfs via the
    "uevent" files.  Each directory in sysfs containing a "dev" file should also
    contain a "uevent" file.  
    
    Write the name of the event (such as "add" or "remove") to the appropriate uevent file, 
    and the kernel will deliver such an event for that device via the hotplug mechanism.

    Note that in kernel versions 2.6.24 and newer, "uevent" is readable.  Reading
    from uevent provides the set of "extra" variables associated with this event.
