xenomai smokey test : task's cpu affinity
=========================================

description
------------

   The test requires one none-realtime cpu set with boot options!
   However in xenomai by default all cpu's are set realtime.
   To run the test we have to configure xenomai to not set all
   cpu's to realtime. We can do this by setting kernel boot option :
   
       xenomai.supported_cpus=<byte_specifying_realtime_cpus>
       
       
    note: 
     - on raspberry pi add boot paramters in /boot/cmdline.txt
     - default: xenomai.supported_cpus=0xf for pi2   =>  1111  => all 4 cpu's are realtime
               -> not pi1 offcourse, because that has only 1 cpu :))
     - to turn cpu0 and cpu1 realtime and cpu2 and cpu3 not  
       set bit0 and bit1 to 1 and others to zero   =>    0011  => 0x3
  
   The test starts with switching the main none-realtime thread to a  none-realtime cpu,
   then it starts a realtime task,  normally the realtime task would inherit its cpu from its parent,
   but because the parent is not realtime the realtime task should migrate to a different cpu which is realtime.  
    => this behavior is tested first, and to test it we need at least one none-realtime cpu!!!
  
   Then the test migrates the realtime task to the other realtime tasks one for one to see if it was succesfull.

how to run test
---------------

as root: run xeno-test                              => runs multiple tests (one of them is cpu_affinity test)
  cpu_affinity skipped (no kernel support)

  => FAILED running cpu_affinity test

as root:
  
  $ /usr/xenomai/bin/smokey --list 
  ..
  #2   cpu_affinity
  ..
  
  $ /usr/xenomai/bin/smokey --run=2  
  cpu_affinity skipped (no kernel support)
  
  $ /usr/xenomai/bin/smokey --run=2 --verbose=2
  .. CPU0 is available
  .. CPU1 is available
  .. CPU2 is available
  .. CPU3 is available
  no CPU restriction with xenomai.supported_cpus
  cpu_affinity skipped (no kernel support)                   => uh?? did we configure something wrong??? NO


  => FAILED running cpu_affinity test
   
   
 source 
  xenomai-3-3.0.5/testsuite/smokey/cpu-affinity/cpu-affinity.c

   => source code looks for  cpu in cpuset which is none-realtime
      if it cannot find such none-realtime cpu then cpu<0  => all cpu's are realtime           => test requires at least 1 none-realtime cpu!! => how do we set this ? see below

    /*
     * If there is no CPU restriction on the bootargs
     * (i.e. xenomai.supported_cpus is absent or does not exclude
     * any online CPU), pretend that we have no kernel support for
     * running this test.
     */
    if (cpu < 0) {
        smokey_trace("no CPU restriction with xenomai.supported_cpus");
        return -ENOSYS;                                                   => Function not implemented.  => smokey translates this into "no kernel support"
    }                                                                         source: xenomai-3-3.0.5/testsuite/smokey//main.c:35:				
                                                                                      if (ret == -ENOSYS) {  smokey_note("%s skipped (no kernel support)"

  note: 
        http://www.xenomai.org/pipermail/xenomai/2015-October/035322.html
 
          with the boot parameter xenomai.supported_cpus=0x1
          
          => only make cpu0 realtime  (cpu1,cpu2,cpu3 are not realtime)

on raspberry pi add boot paramters in /boot/cmdline.txt
  
so added "xenomai.supported_cpus=0x1"  add /boot/cmdline.txt 
    
  # smokey --run=2 --verbose=2
  .. CPU0 is available
  .. CPU1 is online, non-RT
  .. CPU2 is online, non-RT
  .. CPU3 is online, non-RT
  .. control thread binding to non-RT CPU3
  .. starting user thread
  .... user thread starts on CPU0, ok
  .. RTDM test module not available, skipping
  cpu_affinity OK
  
        => SUCCESFUL runned cpu_affinity test
  
  
  => test just requires one none-realtime cpu set with boot options,
     by default all cpu's are set realtime (default: xenomai.supported_cpus=0xf for pi2 (not pi1 offcourse :))
  
     the test starts with switching the main none-realtime thread to a  none-realtime cpu,
     then it starts a realtime task,  normally the realtime task would inherit its cpu from its parent,
     but because the parent is not realtime the realtime task should migrate to a different cpu which is realtime.
