   for switch   http://elinux.org/RPi_Tutorial_EGHS:Switch_Input says 
   
       For the GPIO pin to determine if an input level is HIGH or LOW it has to detect that the voltage on the pin is
       above or below a set level, you should aim to set the pin to 10% of the logic voltage (HIGH for the RPi this is
       3.3V - so
       
            HIGH:   2.97V to 3.3V, 
            LOW:    0V to 0.33V

       If the pin voltage is somewhere between 2.97V and 0.33V then the system may not reliably determine if a HIGH or
       LOW value is set (particularly as you get closer to 1.65V (halfway)).

       input low :   0-0.8V
       input high :  2.2-3.3V
       output low : 0-0.6 V
       output high: 2.4-3.3V
