  Fritzing is an open-source hardware initiative that makes electronics accessible as a creative material for anyone.
  We offer a software tool, a community website and services in the spirit of Processing and Arduino, fostering a
  creative ecosystem that allows users to document their prototypes, share them with others, teach electronics in a
  classroom, and layout and manufacture professional pcbs.


 => great tool to draw a realistic circuit on a raspberry pi

  When you're quite new to electronics, maybe a software simulator to simulate what the electronics would be doing is a
  good idea. Like user @user2813274 said, its about:

     - the maximum amount of current flowing
     - the voltage levels involved

  I found a nice website, where you can fiddle around with electric components and measure the voltage and current
  going through the leds and switches etc. It even visually shows the voltage and current flow.

  This site has a free opensource download. it's a zip file which contains a java program. if you unzip it and
  doubleclick the .jar file, the simulator apears. Pretty advanced electronics can be simulated as well. This is the
  site: http://www.falstad.com/circuit/

  i'm not sure how much you're into electronics. How a LED works for example; it only allows current to flow in one
  direction(that direction in which it lights up), but there's a minimum voltage required to get the current flowing.
  some are 1.7V but there's even LEDS with to 3 Volts. Since the current flowing is dependant on the voltage applied,
  you could let it conduct so much that the flowing current is essentially a short-circuit(i.e. infinite current).
  That's why there's resistors involved in switches and LED's.

  Have fun

iCircuit similator (commercial, but cheap)
=================

 iCircuit is the easy to use electronic circuit simulator and designer - the perfect tool for students, hobbyists, and engineers.
 
 Available for :
	iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch
	Mac OS X
	Windows 8 Store
	Windows Phone 	  Windows Phone
	Android app on Google Play 	  
    Android Phones and Tablets
    
Its advanced simulation engine can handle both analog and digital circuits and features realtime always-on analysis. It
is the perfect companion to students, hobbyists, and engineers.

You use it as you would any CAD program: you add elements, connect them together, and set their properties.

But iCircuit is unlike other CAD programs because it is always simulating. It's just like working with the real
circuit. You do not stop to take a measurement or spend a lot of time configuring reports. Instead, you just play with
the circuit as you normally would, with the power on!

There are over 30 elements you can use to build your circuits. The app has everything from simple resistors, to
switches, to MOSFETs, to digital gates.

The app features a multimeter that you use to probe around the circuit to instantly read voltages and currents. If you
want to see how a value changes over time, then you can add values to the built-in oscilloscope. The scope can
simultaneously track many signals over time and features a touch interface to control the total time displayed and
stacked and unstacked modes to easily compare signals.

Supported elements include:

    Signal generators, Voltage sources, Current sources, and Dependent sources
    Speakers, Microphones, Buzzers, DC Motors, and LEDs
    ADCs, and DACs
    Logic gates: AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR
    JK and D Flip-flops
    38 7400 series digital parts
    7-segment display and driver
    Antenna with simulated AM and FM signals

You can also create sub circuits to introduce new elements and componentize your designs.
No matter your skill set, you'll be playing with circuits in no time with iCircuit.
